# Game

I created a simple language learning game in C++ to help me learn German vocabulary quickly. 

The game will output the English word and prompt the user for the German translation.

If the user gets the word wrong, he/she is given two more chances and receives a small point deduction after each false attempt.

After the user has attempted all the words in the file, a score is outputted along with the vocab words the user struggled with.
